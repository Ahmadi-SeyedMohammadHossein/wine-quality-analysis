# Wine Quality Analysis 🍷

Data-driven analysis of wine quality using Python, Power BI, and Excel.

## Business Question
Which chemical properties have the strongest influence on wine quality, and how can these insights support quality assessment and decision-making?

## Project Overview
This project analyzes red wine quality data to identify key factors influencing quality ratings. 
The analysis combines exploratory data analysis, statistical insights, and interactive dashboards.

## Dataset
- Red Wine Quality Dataset
- Source: Public UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel

## Analysis Workflow
1. Data exploration and cleaning
2. Feature analysis and correlation analysis
3. Visualization of quality drivers
4. Dashboard creation for interactive exploration

## Key Insights
- Alcohol level shows a strong positive correlation with wine quality
- Volatile acidity negatively impacts quality ratings
- High-quality wines tend to have balanced acidity and alcohol content

## Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard includes:
- Quality distribution
- Correlation analysis
- Feature comparison by quality level
- Interactive filters
