# Wine Quality Analysis 🍷

## Project Overview
This project analyzes red wine quality data to identify the chemical and physical properties that most influence wine ratings. 
The analysis combines Python, Power BI, and Excel for a full data-driven approach.

## Business Questions
- Which chemical properties have the strongest influence on wine quality?
- How can producers optimize wine quality based on these insights?
- Which features can be used for predictive modeling of wine quality?

## Dataset
- Red Wine Quality Dataset  
  Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel

## Analysis Workflow
1. Data exploration and cleaning
2. Feature analysis and correlation analysis
3. Visualization of quality drivers
4. Dashboard creation for interactive exploration

## Key Insights
- Alcohol content shows a strong positive correlation with wine quality.
- Volatile acidity negatively impacts quality ratings.
- High-quality wines tend to have a balanced ratio of acidity and alcohol.

## Recommendations
- Monitor and control alcohol and acidity levels during production.
- Use predictive models to guide quality control and production decisions.
- Focus on high-quality batches for premium marketing strategies.

## Power BI & Excel Dashboards
The dashboards include:
- Wine quality distribution
- Feature comparison by quality level
- Correlation analysis
- Interactive filters and slicers
