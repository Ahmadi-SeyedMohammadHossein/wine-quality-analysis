# Wine Quality Analysis 🍷

Data-driven analysis of wine quality using Python, Power BI, and Excel.

---

## Project Overview
This project analyzes red wine quality data to identify the chemical and physical properties that most influence wine ratings. The analysis combines Python, Power BI, and Excel for a full data-driven approach.

---

## Business Questions
- Which chemical properties have the strongest influence on wine quality?  
- How can producers optimize wine quality based on these insights?  
- Which features can be used for predictive modeling of wine quality?

---

## Dataset
- [Raw Data](data/WineQT.csv) – original dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- [Cleaned Data](data/cleaned_WineQT.csv) – cleaned and preprocessed dataset  
- [Analysis-ready Excel](data/cleaned_WineQT - Analyze.xlsx) – prepared for Power BI/Excel visualization

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Python EDA and modeling  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and visualizations  
- **Microsoft Excel**: Additional analysis and views  

---

## Analysis Workflow
1. Data exploration and cleaning  
2. Feature analysis and correlation analysis  
3. Visualization of quality drivers  
4. Interactive dashboard creation (Power BI & Excel)

---

## Key Insights
- Alcohol content shows a strong positive correlation with wine quality.  
- Volatile acidity negatively impacts quality ratings.  
- High-quality wines tend to have a balanced ratio of acidity and alcohol.  
- Random Forest achieved the best predictive performance (highest R² score).  

---

## Recommendations
- Monitor and control alcohol and acidity levels during production.  
- Use predictive models to guide quality control and production decisions.  
- Focus on high-quality batches for premium marketing strategies.

---

## Dashboards & Visualizations
- Quality distribution  
- Feature comparison by quality level  
- Correlation analysis  
- Interactive filters and slicers
